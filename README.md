 Exercise 1:
 Download the wine dataset from the following Machine Learning repository: ML Repository. Rename wine.data to wine.data.csv. In wine.names, you can read the 
 descriptions of all the attributes.
 The dataset contains 13 features (columns 2-14) that contribute to the quality of wine. The
 dataset contains data for three types, i.e., labels, of wines, identified by the category values: 1, 2,
 and 3 (column 1). The dataset contains 178 records. Plot a graph of the testing accuracy of the
 data set for different values of K (use KNN with K=1-10), using a test size of 20%.

 Exercise 2:
 In the given the dataset (Files->Datasets): breast-cancer-wisconsin.zip, perform classification
 using the KNN supervised learning algorithm with K=5 and test_size=0.30. Print the accuracy
 of your model as well as the Visual Confusion Matrix.
